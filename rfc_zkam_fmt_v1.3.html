       <span class="h1">Zero-Kyc Assurance Mechanism for Fiduciary Money Transfer</span>

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>
       
   The objective of Zero-KYC Assurance Mechanism for Fiduciary Money 
   Transfer (ZKAM-FMT) is to ensure that fiat money is transfered 
   from a bank account or a related bank-provided service are sent 
   in the exact amount, with the exact target and from the designated 
   person without a possibility of Man In The Middle attack, spoofing 
   transaction data or pretending the transaction was executed while 
   in reality it was not.

   The procedure works without the need of any kind of integration 
   with electronic systems of Banks or any kind of intervention on 
   their behalf.

   Specific attack this mechanism was designed to stop can be called 
   Man In The Middle P2P Fiat-To-Crypto Financial Spoofing Attack 
   (MPFTC-FSA) and is described in section 2 of this document.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  Description of the attack</span>
   
   In a direct Peer-To-Peer crypto trading market, where users 
   directly enter trade agreements where they exchange 
   a cryptocurrency for a government controlled asset like fiduciary 
   money, MPFTC-FSA can be described in the following way.

<span class="grey">RFC (Draft) 31337                 ZKAM-FMT                    17 July 2024</span>
   
   
   Let’s make some assumptions and definitions to clarify our 
   definition:
   
      - CRYPTO is a hard money-type cryptocurrency without chargeback 
      functionality, for example it can be Bitcoin Cash or Monero.

      - FIAT is a government controlled asset like fiduciary money 
      in an electronic form, with partial or complete chargeback 
      functionality.

      - MARKET is the virtual place and environment on the Internet 
      where users exchange CRYPTO for FIAT and the reverse.

      - Bob is a honest seller of crypto that has publishes a “sell” 
      crypto offer in exchange for a bank fiat transfer. 
      Also he is the first victim.
      
      - Alice is a honest item or service buyer, that is completely 
      unrelated to the CRYPTO/FIAT exchange happening. Due to 
      the attack, she becomes the second victim.
      
      - Charlie is a scammer that enters the exchange on the MARKET 
      executing the attack, victimizing the other participants of 
      the trade.
      
      - ITEM-MARKET is a completely unrelated service where items 
      are traded for FIAT - this can be for example ebay, amazon, 
      craiglist or gumtree.
      
      - ITEM(IPhone) is unrelated goods/services used as a lure by 
      Charlie, the item(s) never actually exist.
    
   The complete attack procedure works as follows:
   
      &bull; Bob, the honest crypto seller puts an offer of sale of CRYPTO 
      (1.00000000 Bitcoin Cash) in exchange for 1000 units of FIAT 
      money executed as a bank wire transfer on the MARKET.

      &bull; Charlie the scammer notices the offer, and makes fake/fraud 
      listing of an ITEM(IPhone) sale on ITEM-MARKET. He sets the 
      price to 1000 units of FIAT money.
      
      &bull; Alice, the honest item buyer, wants to buy an item and notices 
      the offer of Charlie on ITEM-MARKET, she contacts Charlie 
      about the purchase.
      
      &bull; Charlie, having received the item purchase offer from Alice, 
      initiates the trade of the CRYPTO (1 Bitcoin Cash) with Bob. 
      Bob gives Charlie an account number to transfer the FIAT to.
      
      &bull; Charlie responds to the ITEM(IPhone) purchase request from 
      Alice, he gives her the account number received from Bob.
      
      &bull; Alice transfers her FIAT money to Bob’s account.

<span class="grey">RFC (Draft) 31337                 ZKAM-FMT                    17 July 2024</span>
      
      
      &bull; Bob receives the bank FIAT transfer, unlocking the offered 
      CRYPTO to be acquired by Charlie.
      
      &bull; Charlie transfers the CRYPTO to his own wallet.

      &bull; Using technological means, Charlie erases all traces of his 
      existence from the Internet or makes them irrelevant, 
      switching to a new identity: “Elize”.

      &bull; Alice, having not received the ITEM(IPhone), either calls 
      her bank to execute chargeback or contacts the Police in 
      order to investigate the Bob’s account number.

      &bull; Bob the honest seller gets prosecuted by either the Police 
      because of the scam accusation or by his bank because of 
      scam suspect due to a customer’s chargeback.

      &bull; A) After above happens 100 times, in a pessimistic scenario, 
      Bob goes bankrupt/to prison due to lawsuits or being barred 
      from having a bank account because of being perceived 
      by the banking system as a scammer.

      &bull; B) After above happens repeats 100 times, in an optimistic 
      scenario, Bob gets tired of constant problems and accusations 
      and simply stops trading CRYPTO on the MARKET.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>. The significance of the MPFTC-FS attacks in large scale and 
over longer periods of time</span>
      
      Due to their stealthy and near-untraceable nature MPFTC-FS 
      Attacks are extremely dangerous to any kind of direct 
      Peer-To-Peer CRYPTO MARKET because of multiple reasons:

      Unlike many other scam schemes, MARKET is not the target 
      of the scam. The existence of the attack is completely 
      invisible to the MARKET. The attack can potentially get 
      executed thousands of times without the owners/administrators 
      of the MARKET noticing anything out of order is happening.

      Charlie the scammer, being Man In The Middle attacker, can 
      impersonate both other parties of the trade during the 
      communication between them, he can describe himself as “Bob” 
      when communicating with Alice and he can describe himself 
      as “Alice” when communicating with Bob, making detection 
      of this scam very difficult.

      Assuming Alice is not a security&amp;technology expert 
      (which is likely), it is virtually impossible or impractical 
      for her to detect that she is transfering funds to a seller 
      of a crypto market.

      If the number of scammers using the MPFTC-FS Attacks 
      becomes large, it can cause a slow erosion of honest CRYPTO 
      sellers to the point the MARKET becomes severely damaged 
      or even goes bankrupt due to the lack of CRYPTO sellers.

<span class="grey">Shadow Of Harbringer          Informational                     [Page 3]</span></pre>

<span class="grey">RFC (Draft) 31337                 ZKAM-FMT                    17 July 2024</span>

      
      It is therefore highly logical to assume that MPFTC-FS 
      Attacks could be the main cause of the degradation and 
      deaths of many P2P MARKETs that happened and perhaps 
      may/will happen in the future.

      Under normal circumstances, due to the existence of Proxies, 
      TOR relays and other anonymity tools on the Internet, 
      detecting that Charlie is a scammer will be very difficult 
      to the point of being impractical.

      Many services deal with these kind of attacks using various 
      Know-Your-Customer (KYC) policies, that verify that the 
      customer has no fake identity, thus making it hard for 
      Charlie to escape detection and prosecution. Implementation 
      of security mechanisms using KYC is however not the purpose 
      of this RFC Document.

Transfer</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1" href="#section-4.1">4.1</a>. The purpose of the ZKAM-FMT mechanism</span>

      The purpose of ZKAM-FMT mechanism is to 
      
      - Ensure that Bob, the honest CRYPTO seller, cannot receive 
      the FIAT money transfer from any other party than the party 
      he is engaged in the exchange with using the MARKET
      
      - Ensure that Charlie the scammer cannot manipulate Alice, 
      the honest item buyer, to transfer the money to Bob’s bank 
      account in a non-reversible way
      
      - Verify that the bank FIAT money transfer is done exactly 
      by the same person/entity that participates in the exchange 
      of FIAT to CRYPTO using the MARKET
      
      - Execute all of the above without using Know-Your-Customer 
      verification mechanisms

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.2" href="#section-4.2">4.2</a>. Basic design definitions of the ZKAM-FMT mechanism</span>      
      
      The ZKAM-FMT mechanism consists of few main pieces:
      
      - MARKET is the CRYPTO to/from FIAT exchange service 
      running on the Internet
      
      - MARKET APP is a software package, user interface of the 
      MARKET that facilitates the direct P2P trade of CRYPTO. 
      It acts as a means of communication, execution and partially 
      verification for the parties taking part in a FIAT/CRYPTO 
      exchange.
      
      - BROWSER is a software package, sub-section of the MARKET APP,

      software application that is linked to MARKET app 
      in a specific way
      
      - BACKEND are a set of background processes and services 
      that play the main role of execution and verification 
      of the exchange between the market participants.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.3" href="#section-4.3">4.3</a>. Core functionality of the ZKAM-FMT mechanism</span>          
      
      &bull; The ZKAM-FMT mechanism ensures that the crypto buyer cannot 
      make another person execute the FIAT money bank transfer 
      by facilitating BROWSER in the exchange process.
      
      &bull; BROWSER is a software package running on the same device, 
      a critical part of the exchange process and is a trusted 
      part of the MARKET APP, either by being directly integrated 
      by it, being a semi-external component/library or being an 
      external application that is linked with the MARKET APP 
      in a trusted way that cannot be easily manipulated by third 
      parties.

      &bull; The role of the BROWSER is to act as a web browser, using 
      which the CRYPTO buyer on the MARKET log-ins to his back 
      account in order to execute the FIAT money transfer. 
      The BROWSER acts exactly like an usual web browser does, 
      with the exception that it verifies whether certain actions 
      on the bank’s website were executed in a specific manner. 
      Specifically it ensures the most critical variables like 
      Account Number, Account Owner of Receiver, Amount of FIAT 
      and the Title of the transfer match. Another important detail 
      BROWSER verifies is whether the form of the transfer was 
      successfully sent and whether the process ended up in SUCCESS 
      or FAILURE state.

      &bull; The BROWSER then communicates with MARKET APP and BACKEND, 
      either returning the requested information as a whole, 
      or simply returning error code (FILTER variant described 
      in section 4.6 of this RFC Document), corresponding 
      to whether the entered data was correct or not.

      &bull; The MARKET APP then communicates to the CRYPTO seller 
      whether the FIAT transfer was executed by the CRYPTO buyer 
      successfully, giving him options to proceed with unlocking 
      the CRYPTO to the buyer or cancelling the trade or reporting 
      the buyer for scamming.

      &bull; The MARKET APP also strongly communicates to the CRYPTO 
      seller that he should only accept the transfer with 
      a specific transfer title and reject transfer with any other 
      title, in order to further make scenarios of a mistake or scam 
      unlikely to happen.

      &bull; There are various critical security and privacy 
      considerations related to this mechanism, which are 
      described in further sections of this RFC Document.

<span class="grey">RFC (Draft) 31337                 ZKAM-FMT                    17 July 2024</span>
      
<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.4" href="#section-4.4">4.4</a>. Security and user trust considerations</span>          

      Due to the crypto buyer who uses the MARKET APP logging-in 
      to his own bank account using the BROWSER which is an integral 
      part of the MARKET APP or can be seen as such, owners/creators 
      of the MARKET app need to ensure that The BROWSER does not 
      relay any form data more than it is absolutely necessary 
      to the MARKET APP or BACKEND.
      
      This especially applies to any kind of login and password 
      form fields. Omitting such fields can be hard-coded in the 
      application so it is near-impossible for the apllication 
      to return such data to the MARKET APP or BACKEND.
      The BROWSER can be trusted by the user to do the above

      Possible solutions include (but are not limited to):
      - Open sourcing the BROWSER part of the MARKET APP or even 
      the whole MARKET APP, depending on the chosen solution
      
      - Removing all of the stored data from databases after 
      a successful trade
      
      - Precisely describing to the customer that he will be 
      redirected to his bank account site and the data will be 
      only temporarily stored for verification
      
      - Hashing data fields and relaying hashed values instead 
      of raw text values, described in section 4.7 of this RFC 
      Document

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.5" href="#section-4.5">4.5</a>. Data Privacy &amp; Legal considerations </span>

      Assuming proper implementation in the spirit of this RFC 
      document, neither the MARKET APP or the BROWSER will never 
      relay any personal information of the person making a FIAT 
      transfer. The only information that is verified and 
      temporarily stored is the Account Data of the Fiat Receiver, 
      but this is already the case because the trade participants 
      usually share such data on the internal chat of the MARKET 
      APP, which implies that some of it is also at least 
      temporarily stored.

      So privacy-wise and legal-wise (taking EU’s GDPR laws and US’ 
      CCPA laws into account), ZKAM-FMT mechanism should not create 
      any significant change in this regard.
      
      
<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.6" href="#section-4.6">4.6</a>. Internal mechanics: BROWSER with FILTER variant </span>
       
      To strongly minimize the possibility of mistakes and data leaks, 
      there exists an alternative way in which the BROWSER can be 
      implemented.

      The BROWSER-FILTER variant, in the process of redirection 
      of the crypto buyer to his bank website for the purpose 
      of making FIAT transfer, the BROWSER only receives the few 

<span class="grey">Shadow Of Harbringer          Informational                     [Page 6]</span></pre>

<span class="grey">RFC (Draft) 31337                 ZKAM-FMT                    17 July 2024</span>

      important pieces of data from BACKEND and verifies whether 
      they match to the data entered into the website form by the 
      user plus it verifies whether the process ended up in success 
      or failure. No data at all, except error code (signifying 
      the SUCCESS or FAILURE) is sent back to neither MARKET APP 
      or BACKEND.

      This ensures that even in the case of software failures 
      and bugs in BROWSER, the probability of returning some 
      critical private data of the account owner like login, 
      password, OTP codes or similar and accidentally storing 
      it by BACKEND is negligible and unrealistic in practice.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.7" href="#section-4.7">4.7</a>. Internal mechanics: BROWSER with HASHED FILTER variant </span>
      
      Relaying hashes of data field’s contents instead of raw data 
      between MARKET APP, BACKEND and BROWSER can be employed 
      to further further eradicate legal and security risks related 
      to even temporarily storing user information.

      Using the BROWSER-HASHED-FILTER variant, the critical data 
      crypto seller enters (like account number, account name, 
      amount) can be turned to hashes and then sent to the BACKEND 
      in this form. BACKEND then relays these hashes to BROWSER 
      and the browser verifies whether the hashes of the data 
      entered by the user on the bank website match the supplied 
      hashes. If the hashes match and the FIAT transfer process 
      ends in success, BROWSER returns success code, otherwise it 
      returns error code depending on in what manner the process 
      failed.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>. Example event flows</span>

      To describe the ZKAM-FMT event flow in full detail, let’s 
      first make additional definitions and assumptions.
      Previous definitions described in section 4.2 also apply.
      
      - THE COMPANY is the legal entity owning and maintaining
      the MARKET, MARKET APP, BACKEND and BROWSER.
      
      - Bob is a honest seller of CRYPTO that has publishes 
      a SELL crypto offer in exchange for a bank FIAT transfer.
      
      - Dave is a CRYPTO buyer that enters into the exchange 
      with Bob in order to purchase CRYPTO for FIAT.


<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1" href="#section-5.1">5.1</a>. Event flow A: A success scenario</span>
      
      Sequence of events:
      
        1. Bob, the honest crypto seller puts an offer of sale 
        of CRYPTO (1.00000000 Bitcoin Cash) in exchange for 1000 
        units of FIAT money executed as a bank wire transfer 
        on the MARKET.

<span class="grey">Shadow Of Harbringer          Informational                     [Page 7]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-8"></span>
<span class="grey">RFC (Draft) 31337                 ZKAM-FMT                    17 July 2024</span>
        
        2. Dave the buyer notices the offer and responds 
        to it. He initiates the trade of the CRYPTO (1 Bitcoin 
        Cash) with Bob.

        3. The BACKEND generates an unique and random transfer 
        title: “YYY-RND-YYY” which will be used as an unique 
        transfer title in order to avoid mistakes.

        4. MARKET APP displays a prompt to Dave:
        “You will now be redirected to your bank where you will 
        make a transfer of 1000.00 units of FIAT to Account 
        Number XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX owned by Bob Bobinsky, 
        please use the transfer title YYY-RND-YYY”
        “Please choose your bank from the listed banks”

        5. Dave chooses his bank, MARKET APP opens BROWSER 
        with the URL locked in to the location of the bank 
        website. 
        Dave cannot change the URL, all means of manually 
        entering and modifying the URL ale locked out in the 
        BROWSER, the BROWSER has no URL bar.

        6. Dave log-ins into the Bank website, enters all 
        given account data, confirms the transfer with an OTP 
        code.

        7. Once the FIAT transfer process succeeds, BROWSER 
        software is closed and Dave is moved back to the 
        MARKET APP.

        8. BROWSER relays the requested data plus success 
        status to BACKEND and/or MARKET APP.

        9. The BACKEND receives the success code from BROWSER 
        or MARKET APP and the internal logic decides to notify 
        the CRYPTO seller Bob.

        10. Bob receives the confirmation of the FIAT transfer 
        success and a prompt:

        11. “FIAT money transfer of 1000.00 units to your 
        account XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX is on its way to you”
        “Warning: please only accept a transfer titled 
        ‘YYY-RND-YYY’, otherwise reject/return the transfer”

        12. Once money is in his account, Bob unlocks 
        the CRYPTO to be transfered by Dave into his own 
        wallet.

        13. Dave transfers the CRYPTO to his own wallet.

        1. Bob, the honest crypto seller puts an offer of sale 
        of CRYPTO (1.00000000 Bitcoin Cash) in exchange for 1000 
        units of FIAT money executed as a bank wire transfer 
        on the MARKET.

        2. Charlie the scammer notices the offer, and makes 
        fake/fraud listing of an ITEM(IPhone) sale on ITEM-MARKET. 
        He sets the price to 1000 units of FIAT money.
      
        3. Alice, the honest item buyer, wants to buy an item 
        and notices the offer of Charlie on ITEM-MARKET, she 
        contacts Charlie about the purchase.
      
        4. Charlie, having received the item purchase offer from 
        Alice, initiates the trade of the CRYPTO (1 Bitcoin Cash) 
        with Bob. 
        
        5. The BACKEND generates an unique and random transfer 
        title: “YYY-RND-YYY” which will be used as an unique 
        transfer title in order to avoid mistakes.

        6. MARKET APP displays a prompt to Charlie:
        “You will now be redirected to your bank where you will 
        make a transfer of 1000.00 units of FIAT to Account 
        Number XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX owned by Bob Bobinsky, 
        please use the transfer title YYY-RND-YYY”
        “Please choose your bank from the listed banks”
        
        7. MARKET APP opens BROWSER with the URL locked 
        in to the location of the bank website. 
      
        8. Charlie log-ins into the Bank website, enters all 
        given account data and changes the amount to a much smaller 
        amount than requested by the MARKET APP in hope to cheat
        the process, then executes the transfer, confirming 
        it with an OTP code.

        9. Once the FIAT transfer process goes through, BROWSER 
        software is closed and Charlie is moved back to the 
        MARKET APP.

        10. BROWSER relays the requested data plus transaction 
        status to BACKEND and/or MARKET APP.

        10. The BACKEND receives the data from BROWSER or MARKET APP 
        and the internal logic decides that the transaction was 
        fraudulent because the amount was invalid, generates 
        an error code (STATUS: INVALID AMOUNT).
        
        11. The BACKEND decides to notify the CRYPTO seller Bob 
        that Charlie tried to cheat the purchase process.

        12. Charlie, assuming he will succeed to cheat the process,
        responds to the ITEM(IPhone) purchase request from Alice, 
        he gives her the account number received from Bob and tells
        her to use the transfer title “YYY-RND-YYY” received from 
        MARKET APP.
      
        13. Alice transfers her FIAT money to Bob’s account.
      
        14. The internal logic of MARKET APP decides to interrupt 
        the purchase process and mark the trade as invalid, 
        locking out the crypto payout from Bob.
        
        15. Bob receives the notification about fraudulent cancelled
        trade and is told to return any unidentified FIAT transfered 
        to his account having the title “YYY-RND-YYY” or the amount 
        "1000" back to sender.
        
        16. THE COMPANY notifies the authorities about the fraud 
        attempt, giving collected data (like an IP address, used bank 
        URL) of Charlie to the authorities.
        
        17. Having understood the situation, crypto seller Bob 
        returns received FIAT back to Alice.
        
        18. Charlie is later prosecuted for attempting 
        a Man-In-The-Middle market scam.
